\abstract
With the growth of Big Data and Machine Learning applications in fields such as
Smart Cities, Smart Farming and Healthcare, the Internet of Things plays a key
role in facilitating these projects, which intensifies the IoT industry to keep
constantly researching technologies like LPWAN, that allows the scattering of
smart devices in large urban and rural areas. Among then LoRa is standing out
for its attractive features for long-distance IoT systems. However LoRa technology
does not provide a network support to the IoT system developer. In this way, this
thesis proposes a LoRa-based network protocol to provide network support to the
IoT system developer.
